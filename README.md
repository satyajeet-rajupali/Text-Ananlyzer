# Text-Analyzer

Text-Analyzer is a dynamic text analysis website hosted on Firebase, offering a suite of powerful text manipulation tools. Users can effortlessly convert text between lowercase and uppercase, eliminate excessive spaces, and access real-time word and character count. Additionally, the website includes a robust spellchecker with spell suggestions. To enhance user experience, I implemented both dark and light modes for accessibility and customization.
